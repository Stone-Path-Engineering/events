**Date:**  July 24th, 2025

**Time:**  11:00 AM - 12:30 PM

**Place:** Either/Or, 6222 Grand Ave, Des Moines, IA, 50312

Testing. A quagmire of questions. Should we be doing unit, integration, or acceptance tests? What makes code testable? What makes hardware testable? Should we test manually, with automation, or a combination? What’s the difference between simulation and emulation? How do we simulate things like Bluetooth or sensors? Can we test anything after devices are in customer’s hands? Where do we even begin??!!?

At July’s Firmware Fellowship, we’ll be sharing what we know and sitting on the edge of our seats to learn from you! Don’t be afraid to join us, there won’t be any pop quizzes!

Grab some lunch from Either/Or and join us to "test" our knowledge on Testing Embedded Systems. Unfortunately, meals can't be covered by Iowans of Things, so plan accordingly.
