**Time:**  11:00 AM - 12:30 PM

**Place:** The Walnut - 1417 Walnut St, Des Moines, IA 50309

Join us for another Firmware Fellowship event! This technical workshop focuses on embedded firmware development best practices and provides a forum for developers to share expertise and learn from each other.

This month's topic is Commanding the Command Line. 

Vendor IDEs and PlatformIO have gotten many people through 100% of their firmware development, but the command line opens up a new category of super powers. We'll also have some useful info you can use even if you never plan on opening a terminal. 

At Firmware Fellowship, we meet in a casual lunch setting to share what we know and to learn from you! Don’t be afraid to join us, there won’t be any pop quizzes!
