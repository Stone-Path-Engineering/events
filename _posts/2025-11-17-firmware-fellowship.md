Join us for Firmware Fellowship on the third Thursday of every month! This technical discussion focuses on embedded firmware development best practices and provides a forum for developers to share expertise and learn from each other.

November's topic is Observability and Field Support. We'll discuss the tools and techniques to knowing how your devices are performing once they have been sent to your customers. 


At Firmware Fellowship, we meet in a casual lunch setting to share what we know and to learn from you! Don’t be afraid to join us, there won’t be any pop quizzes!
