**Date:**  April 17th, 2025

**Time:**  11:00 AM - 12:30 PM

**Place:** Maxie's Supper Club

Firmware Fellowship is a new event hosted by Iowans of Things. The goal for these events is to discuss best practices around embedded firmware. It will be very similar to WebGeeks and user groups for specific languages where someone presents a topic or hosts a workshop. Topics will be more specific to firmware development than the Hardware Hangout topics. 

The topic for this Firmware Fellowship is toolchains for bare-metal MCU projects. There sure are a lot of them, and they all have their quirks and features. Come discuss your favorites, gripe about how many versions of Eclipse you have installed, and share your tips and recommendations with others!
