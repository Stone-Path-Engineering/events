**Date:**  November 13th, 2025

**Time:**  4:30 PM - 6:30 PM

**Place:** Elevator, 204 12th St, Des Moines, IA 50309

Join us for the November Hardware Hangout! This networking event brings together embedded developers, electronics engineers, hobbyists, and industry supporters for technical discussions and community building.

The topic for the November Hardware Hangout is After the Release. 

Once you've made it through prototyping, development, manufacturing, and selling your product, kick back and celebrate your achievement! But not for too long because you're not done! A whole new set of decisions to make and challenges to overcome await you. Warehousing and shipping, returns and customer support, bug fixes, updates and new features. It's almost another whole job! 

Share your stories, tips, and questions with the group!
